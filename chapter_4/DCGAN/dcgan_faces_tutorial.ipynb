        "They are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a\n",
        "*discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn ‘fake’ images that\n",

        "at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a\n",
        "fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is\n",
